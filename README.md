Jarrett Jimeno, Madhumita Roy, and Cristina Tortora (2020) Clustering Mixed-Type Data: a benchmark study on KAMILA and K-prototypes. IFCS2019 conference proceedings, accepted.

Abstract: Benchmarking in cluster analysis is the process of analyzing whichclustering techniques give the best result for different types of data structuresas well as setting a standard for evaluation of newer clustering methods. Thereare many instances of benchmarking in cluster analysis for continuous data,but only a few for mixed-type data, i.e. data sets with nominal and continuousvariables. Therefore, we explore the process for benchmarking various cluster-ing methods on simulated mixed-type data sets with varying proportions ofcontinuous and nominal variables. For this purpose, we test a newer cluster-ing  algorithm,  KAMILA,  against  K-prototypes  and  tandem  analysis  wheredata are pre-processed using multiple correspondence analysis and then clus-tered  using  K-means,  fuzzy  K-means,  probabilistic  distance  clustering (PD) and Student-t mixture models.
